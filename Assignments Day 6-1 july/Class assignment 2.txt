CLASS ASSIGNMENT DAY 6

Problem 2

Write a C program which will double the value of the normal variable inside user defined function
named 'Double1()" and 'Double2()" will be use pass by value and DOuble2 will use the pass by reference
(pointer). After callin the Double1() and Double2(). Print the value of the variable inside the main().

CODE

#include <stdio.h>
 
void Double1(int x) {
    x = x * 2;
}
 
void Double2(int *x) {
    *x = *x * 2;
}
 
int main() {
    int x = 20; // Initial value of x
    printf("Original value of x: %d\n", x);
    // Call Double1() (pass by value)
    Double1(x);
    printf("Value of x after Double1(): %d\n", x); // x remains unchanged
    // Call Double2() (pass by reference)
    Double2(&x);
    printf("Value of x after Double2(): %d\n", x); // x is doubled
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT

Original value of x: 20
Value of x after Double1(): 20
Value of x after Double2(): 40
