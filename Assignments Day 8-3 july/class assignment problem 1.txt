        return 1;
    }
 
    fprintf(fp, "Name: %s\nSalary: %.2f\n", name, salary);

    char name[50];
    float salary;
 
    fp = fopen("employee.txt", "r"); // Open file in read mode
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!");
        return 1;
    }
 
    fscanf(fp, "Name: %s\nSalary: %f\n", name, &salary);
    printf("Name: %s\nSalary: %.2f\n", name, salary);
