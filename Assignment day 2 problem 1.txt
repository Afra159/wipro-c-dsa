ASSIGNMENT DAY 2

Problem 1

Create a detailed pseudocode for the program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even, or the cube if it's odd,
and then outputs the result. We'll incorporate conditional and looping constructors.

Pseudocode:

1. Enter the input value
2. Take the input value as x
3. for (i=0; i<=n; i++)
3. If i % 2 == 0 then print x*x (It prints the square)
4. Else print x*x*x (It prints the cube)
